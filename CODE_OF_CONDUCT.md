most importantly a checks-and-balances authority so that an abuses of power (or displays without consciousness) can be handled appropriately.  That said, enjoy and remember
there is always someone out there that can do better - and if not, piss 10 of them off and see what happens

                                NO.  2      WHAT KIND OF A GIFT DO YOU GET SOMEONE WHO HAS EVERYTHING...   ANSWER: LESS.   Sometimes peope are mistaken for fools, deviants, truants etc.. when the most simplistic
                                appproach is to recognize.. they had too many options.. with every flavor (and its combinations, combinations) sometimes it takes awhile just to get acclimated, let alone productive
